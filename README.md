Dynamic Website Navigation and Suggestion Retrieval

Project Overview
This project allows users to navigate dynamically across websites or receive suggestions based on voice input. It utilizes algorithms to match the closest available websites and interprets responses effectively using prompts. The backend is powered by a GPT-like structure, performing combinations and retrieving website data dynamically through an API, ensuring minimal webpage load and fast response time.

Key Features
Dynamic Navigation: Navigate to websites or receive suggestions using voice input.
Closest Match Algorithm: Uses algorithms to find the closest website match based on input.
GPT-like Backend: A backend structure that performs all possible combinations to retrieve website data dynamically.
Efficient Response Handling: Ensures fast response time and minimal load on the webpage.

Libraries
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the backend server. (To be integrated soon)
dotenv: Used for loading environment variables from a .env file to keep sensitive information secure. (To be integrated soon)
axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests and fetching website data dynamically. (To be integrated soon)
fuse.js: Lightweight fuzzy-search library used for matching user input with available websites. (To be integrated soon)
react: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, including integration for voice input features.
nodemon: Utility for monitoring changes during development and automatically restarting the server. (To be integrated soon)
cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in API responses. (To be integrated soon)
body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies, particularly useful in POST requests. (To be integrated soon)

APIs
Google Custom Search API: Used to fetch search results and retrieve website data dynamically based on user queries.
Gemini API: Processes and ranks the retrieved URLs based on relevance to user input.
Voice Recognition API (React Library): Converts voice input to text, enabling dynamic navigation and interaction based on spoken commands.

Backend Integration
Backend Server: The backend server will be integrated soon to manage API requests, handle user input, and process website data dynamically.
